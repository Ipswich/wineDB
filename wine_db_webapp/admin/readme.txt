This folder contains the tools under the admin toolbar on the website.
If you wish to change permissions to these tools, the *availability of access to
these tools* is available under the navbar in /includes. However, the *ACCESS TO
THESE TOOLS* is controlled individually under each file. Simply change the
authenticationcheck# to the value of choice (1-5).
