# WineDB
### About
WineDB, developed in 2017 for Chemeketa Community College's CS275, is a MariaDB/PHP driven web app for managing a personal wine collection. As the class's intended purpose was more inline with understanding and designing databases than building a website, the overarching project of "design and implement a database" was completed with a group. However, because the class was not structured to be coding heavy (other groups used Microsoft Access), virtually all of the website development and database infrastructure was managed by myself. Loosely, developing and designing this web interface was a first for me with regard to building a real, purposeful website.

### Features
 * User Accounts with permissions levels to track bottle movement
 * Password recovery by email (requires an email account for the app)
 * Manage varietals of wine
 * Search bottles of wine by a multitude of characteristics
 * Add new bottles of wine by individual or batch
 * Remove bottles of wine by searched bottle number

### Implementation
WineDB was deployed using XAMPP on a Raspberry Pi B+. The database and accounts were setup using PHPMyAdmin as an easy to use interface.
